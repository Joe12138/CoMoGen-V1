# CoMoGen-V1

## Project Overview

CoMoGen-V1 is a controllable multimodal motion behavior generation framework, which is focused on motion behavior generation and argumentation. The framework can generate high-quality traffic simulations, supporting various complex driving situations, and provides rich scenario data for testing and validation of autonomous driving algorithms.

## Key Features

### üéØ Scenario Generation
- **Intersection Scenarios**: Support for various intersection configurations and traffic flow patterns
- **Roundabout Scenarios**: Generate complex roundabout traffic scenarios, including multi-lane and different turning requirements
- **Road Blockage Scenarios**: Simulate road construction, accidents, and other blockage situations
- **Multi-vehicle Interaction**: Support complex interaction scenarios between one vehicle and multiple vehicles

### üîç Scenario Argumentation
- **Chinese Road Merging Scenarios**: Vehicle merging behavior tailored to Chinese road characteristics
- **US Intersection Scenarios**: Intersection interactions compliant with US traffic rules
- **Roundabout Enhancement Scenarios**: High-complexity roundabout traffic argumentation scenarios
